/** @mainpage libsigc++ Reference Manual
 *
 * @section description Description
 *
 * libsigc++ provides a typesafe (at compile time) callback system for standard
 * C++. It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
 * callback function, either a global or a member function, regardless of whether
 * it is static or virtual. It also contains adaptor classes for connection of
 * dissimilar callbacks.
 *
 * For instance, see the @ref signal "Signals", @ref sigcfunctors "Functors",
 * @ref slot "Slots" and @ref adaptors "Adaptors".
 *
 * See also the
 * <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/libsigc++-tutorial/stable/">libsigc++ tutorial</a>,
 * the <a href="https://libsigcplusplus.github.io/libsigcplusplus/">libsigc++ website</a>, and
 * the <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/unstable/chapter-signals.html">Signals
 * appendix of the Programming with gtkmm book</a>.
 *
 * @section features Features
 *
 * - Compile-time typesafe callbacks (also faster than run time checks)
 * - Type-safety violations report the line number correctly with template names
 *   (no tracing template failures into headers)
 * - No compiler extensions or meta compilers required
 * - Proper handling of dynamic objects and signals (deleted objects will not
 *   cause crashes)
 * - Extendable API at any level: signal, slot, connection and trackable
 * - Extensions do not require alteration of basic components
 * - User-definable accumulators
 * - A variety of adaptors to change the callback signature: bind, hide,
 *   retype, and compose
 *
 * @section basics Basic Usage
 *
 * Include the libsigc++ header:
 * @code
 * #include <sigc++/sigc++.h>
 * @endcode
 * (You may include individual headers, such as @c sigc++/bind.h instead.)
 *
 * If your source file is @c program.cc, you can compile it with:
 * @code
 * g++ program.cc -o program `pkg-config --cflags --libs sigc++-3.0`
 * @endcode
 * If your version of g++ is not C++17-compliant by default,
 * add the @c -std=c++17 option.
 *
 * @subsection meson Using Meson
 *
 * If using <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a>, include the following
 * in @c meson.build:
 * @code
 * sigc_dep = dependency('sigc++-3.0')
 * program_name = 'program'
 * cpp_sources = [ 'program.cc' ]
 * executable(program_name,
 *   cpp_sources,
 *   dependencies: sigc_dep
 * )
 * @endcode
 *
 * Your @c dependencies: keyword argument should also mention any other libraries
 * that you need to use.
 *
 * @subsection autotools Using Autotools
 *
 * Alternatively, if using autoconf, use the following in @c configure.ac:
 * @code
 * PKG_CHECK_MODULES([DEPS], [sigc++-3.0])
 * @endcode
 * Then use the generated @c DEPS_CFLAGS and @c DEPS_LIBS variables
 * in the project @c Makefile.am files. For example:
 * @code
 * yourprogram_CPPFLAGS = $(DEPS_CFLAGS)
 * yourprogram_LDADD = $(DEPS_LIBS)
 * @endcode
 *
 * Your @c PKG_CHECK_MODULES() call should also mention any other libraries that
 * you need to use via pkg-config.
 *
 * @subsection cmake Using CMake
 *
 * If using CMake, use the following in @c CMakeList.txt:
 * @code
 * include(FindPkgConfig)
 * pkg_check_modules(DEPS REQUIRED sigc++-3.0)
 * include_directories(${DEPS_INCLUDE_DIRS})
 * target_link_libraries(yourprogram ${DEPS_LIBRARIES})
 * @endcode
 *
 * Your @c pkg_check_modules() call should also mention any other libraries that
 * you need to use via pkg-config.
