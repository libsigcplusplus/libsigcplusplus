/** Convenience class for safe disconnection, including automatic disconnection
 * upon destruction.
 *
 * This is a variant of @ref sigc::connection which also disconnect()s the slot
 * automatically when the scoped_connection is destructed or re-assigned. Refer
 * to @ref sigc::connection for full information about the common functionality.
 *
 * You will use sigc::scoped_connection by constructing it from a ‘normal’,
 * unscoped @ref sigc::connection, such as those returned by 
 * @ref sigc::signal_with_accumulator::connect() "sigc::signal::connect()", thus
 * ‘wrapping’ the connection in a scoped_connection, adding auto-disconnection.
 * It can also be assigned from an unscoped connection, in which case, if there
 * was a previous slot referred to by the scoped connection, it is disconnected.
 *
 * Once a connection is scoped, it canʼt be copied as that would make it unclear
 * which of the copies would hold responsibility to auto-disconnect the slot. It
 * can, however, be moved, so itʼs usable in containers or so ‘ownership’ of the
 * connection/auto-disconnect can be moved to another instance. Moving from the
 * scoped_connection clears its reference to the slot so it wonʼt disconnect it.
 *
 * If you want a reference-counted scoped_connection, wrap in a std::shared_ptr.
 *
 * @code
 * // Automatic disconnection:
 * {
 *   sigc::scoped_connection sconn = sig.connect(&some_function);
 *   // Do stuff that requires the slot to be connected & called.
 * }
 * // The scoped_connection was destroyed, so the slot is no longer connected.
 *
 * // ***
 *
 * // Moving ownership:
 * {
 *   sigc::scoped_connection sconn = sig.connect(&some_function);
 *   // Do stuff that requires the slot to be connected & called.
 *   take_ownership(std::move(sconn)); // Pass by rvalue.
 * }
 * // Now our `sconn` no longer referred to slot, so it did NOT auto-disconnect.
 *
 * // ***
 *
 * // Shared ownership:
 * {
 *   auto shconn = std::make_shared<sigc::scoped_connection>(sig.connect(&some_function));
 *   take_copy(shconn); // Pass by copy/value
 *   // Now we AND take_copy() must destroy our shared_ptr to auto-disconnect().
 * }
 * // take_copy() may still hold a shared_ptr reference, keeping the slot alive.
