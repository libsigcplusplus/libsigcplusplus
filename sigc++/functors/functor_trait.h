/** @defgroup sigcfunctors Functors
 * Functors are copyable types that define operator()().
 *
 * Types that define operator()() overloads with different return types are referred to
 * as multi-type functors. Multi-type functors are only partially supported in libsigc++.
 *
 * Closures are functors that store all information needed to invoke a callback from operator()().
 *
 * Adaptors are functors that alter the signature of a functor's operator()().
 *
 * libsigc++ defines numerous functors, closures and adaptors.
 * Since libsigc++ is a callback library, most functors are also closures.
 * The documentation doesn't distinguish between functors and closures.
 *
 * The basic functor types libsigc++ provides are created with ptr_fun() and mem_fun()
 * and can be converted into slots implicitly.
 * The set of adaptors that ships with libsigc++ is documented in the @ref adaptors module.
