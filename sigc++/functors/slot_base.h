 * same function signature as the functor, thus allowing for
 * implicit conversions.
 *
 * The base class slot_rep serves the purpose to
 * - form a common pointer type (slot_rep*),
 * - offer the possibility to create duplicates (clone()),
 * - offer a notification callback (notify_slot_rep_invalidated()),
 * - implement some of slot_base's interface that depends
 *   on the notification callback, i.e.
 *   -# the possibility to set a single parent with a callback
 *      (set_parent()) that is executed from notify_slot_rep_invalidated(),
 *   -# a generic function pointer, call_, that is simply
 *      set to zero in notify_slot_rep_invalidated() to invalidate the slot.
 *
 * slot_rep inherits trackable so that connection objects can
 * refer to the slot and are notified when the slot is destroyed.

/** @defgroup slot Slots
 * Slots are type-safe representations of callback methods and functions.
 * A slot can be constructed from any function object or function, regardless of
 * whether it is a global function, a member method, static, or virtual.
 *
 * @section slots-creating Creating Slots
 *
 * Use the sigc::mem_fun() or sigc::ptr_fun() template functions to get a sigc::slot, like so:
 * @code
 * sigc::slot<void(int)> sl = sigc::mem_fun(someobj, &SomeClass::somemethod);
 * @endcode
 * or
 * @code
 * sigc::slot<void(int)> sl = sigc::ptr_fun(&somefunction);
 * @endcode
 * or, in gtkmm,
 * @code
 * m_Button.signal_clicked().connect( sigc::mem_fun(*this, &MyWindow::on_button_clicked) );
 * @endcode
 *
 * The compiler will complain if SomeClass::somemethod, etc. have the wrong signature.
 *
 * You can also pass slots as method parameters where you might normally pass a function pointer.
 *
 * @section slots-auto-disconnect Member Methods and Automatic Disconnection
 *
 * See @ref mem_fun "sigc::mem_fun()" about deriving from sigc::trackable to prevent member
 * methods from being called after the instance has been destroyed.
 *
 * @section slots-auto auto
 *
 * sigc::mem_fun() and sigc::ptr_fun() return functors, but those functors are
 * not slots.
 * @code
 * sigc::slot<void(int)> sl = sigc::mem_fun(someobj, &SomeClass::somemethod);
 * @endcode
 * is not equivalent to
 * @code
 * auto sl = sigc::mem_fun(someobj, &SomeClass::somemethod); // Not a slot!
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you don't explicitly use a sigc::slot then the slot could call a method
 * on an instance after it has been destroyed even if the method is in a class
 * that derives from sigc::trackable.
 *
 * @section slots-with-lambdas C++ Lambdas
 *
 * A C++11 lambda expression is a functor (function object). It is automatically
 * wrapped in a slot, if it is connected to a signal.
 * @code
 * auto on_response = [&someobj] (int response_id)
 *   {
 *     someobj.somemethod(response_id);
 *     somefunction(response_id);
 *   };
 * m_Dialog.signal_response().connect(on_response);
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you connect a C++11 lambda expression or a std::function<> instance to
 * a signal or assign it to a slot, if your functor contains references to
 * sigc::trackable derived objects, those objects will not be tracked,
 * unless you also use sigc::track_obj().
