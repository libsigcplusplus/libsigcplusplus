 * @code
 * signal_clicked.connect( sigc::mem_fun(*this, &MyWindow::on_clicked) );
 * @endcode
 *
 * When the signal is emitted your method will be called.
 *
 * signal::connect() returns a connection, which you can later use to disconnect your method.
 * If the type of your object inherits from sigc::trackable the method is disconnected
 * automatically when your object is destroyed.
 *
 * When signals are copied they share the underlying information,
 * so you can have a protected/private sigc::signal member and a public accessor method.
 * A sigc::signal is a kind of reference-counting pointer. It's similar to
 * std::shared_ptr<>, although sigc::signal is restricted to holding a pointer to
 * a sigc::internal::signal_impl object that contains the implementation of the signal.

 *
 * signal and slot objects provide the core functionality of this
 * library. A slot is a container for an arbitrary functor.
 * A signal is a list of slots that are executed on emission.
 * For compile time type safety a list of template arguments
 * must be provided for the signal template that determines the
 * parameter list for emission. Functors and closures are converted
 * into slots implicitly on connection, triggering compiler errors
 * if the given functor or closure cannot be invoked with the
 * parameter list of the signal to connect to.
 *
 * Almost any functor with the correct signature can be converted to a sigc::slot
 * and connected to a signal. See @ref slot "Slots" and sigc::signal::connect().

 * A sigc::internal::signal_impl object is dynamically allocated from signal_base
 * when first connecting a slot to the signal. This ensures that empty signals
 * don't waste memory.
 *
 * sigc::internal::signal_impl is reference-counted. When a sigc::signal# object
